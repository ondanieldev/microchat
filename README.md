## Introduction

[Microchat](https://microchat.ondaniel.com.br/) is a simple chat made with microservices architecture. First, it was being developed as a challenge to join [Ioasys](https://ioasys.com.br/). However, I was hired by another company, so I developed it just to learn more about sockets and microservices.
